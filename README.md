# Action Music
The most easy action music mod to use and make packs for in Garry's mod.

This repository contains source code for the mod itself, action builder made in python and action builder made in c++. Python version is soon to be deprecated once the C++ version is verified to be stable enough.

Both action builder versions can be found in releases and are meant only for windows, however I will at the very least try to support translation layers such as wine.

Guide for both can be seen here: https://youtu.be/-9ji4sEhwfE
