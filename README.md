# gm-action-music
 Dynamic Action Music for GMOD. Inspired by DYNAMO and Nombat

## Features:
 - Automatic fade-in and fade-out.
 - Ease of use
 - Dynamo/sbm and nombat pack parsing
 - Different types of "actions": battle, intensive battle, ambient

## How to use:
 Download the mod, put it into your addons folder and then create your own music pack by creating a folder, creating directories sound->am_music->battle/battle_intensive/background and sorting your music accordingly. Alternatively you may download dynamo/sbm and nombat packs, they will be parsed as well. One thing you have to keep in mind is that all different types have to be filled, otherwise your console will be spammed.

## To note:
This is pretty raw in the current state but in the limited testing it had I deem it github-worthy for now.
