<h1>Action Music pack creation tool</h1>
<p>This tool was created in hopes to speed up and un-monotonize the work in creating packs for the Action Music mod by providing an UI to go over the songs and configure their state.</p>
<p>This tool additionally makes work with yt-dlp, mpv, khinsider and gmpublisher a bit faster by either providing shortcuts or integrating them within the program.</p>
<p>To use mpv, ytdl and gmpublisher you must install them. You can do so within the program itself or manually by providing your own binaries in the tools/ directory.</p>
<p>To use it download the latest release or use it from source (Download python 3.11, install requirements from requirements.txt, run main.py). The release version does not require any installation as it's packaged using cx-freeze.</p>
